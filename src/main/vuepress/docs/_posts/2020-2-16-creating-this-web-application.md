# Creating this web application

I am a backend developer. Of course I have done html, css, javascript. 

Of course, I have done jsp, jsf and struts as well.

But modern frontend does not look like that. So I decided I wanted to learn about Vue.js.

This web app does not have much content yet. But it does contain a lot of technology underneath.

At this post I will describe every component used to bring this together, and some lessons I have
learned along the way.
